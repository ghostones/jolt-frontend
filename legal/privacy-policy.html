    <p><strong>Last updated: January 2026</strong></p>

    <p>
      JOLT ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting
      your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Chat Content & Moderation</h2>
    <p>
      Chats may be analyzed automatically and/or reviewed manually for safety,
      moderation, and abuse prevention. Chat content is not sold or shared for
      advertising purposes. Access to moderation data is restricted and protected.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
      JOLT uses cookies or local storage only for essential functionality such as

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>

      completely secure.
